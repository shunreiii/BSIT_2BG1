= WHY OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING MATTERS =

Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in)

Scanner -> Class
Scan -> Object
Scanner(System.in) -> constructor

ClassName(){
NAKATAGONG CONSTRUCTOR SA ISANG BUONG PROGRAM OR UNDER 1 CLASS
}

= THE PROBLEM WITH PROCEDURAL PROGRAMMING =
1. Divided into procedures and functions
2. Works for small programs
3. Becomes difficult to manage in large systems
4. data and logic are separated, leading to complexity

OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
EX.:
1 chef cooks
1 serves
1 handles orders

- Organizes codes into reusable objects
- groups data and behavior together
- makes large system manageable and scalable
- Promotes code reuse and easier maintenance

= ADVANTAGES =
* Less repetition
* Better organization
